The 2020 election unfolded during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which profoundly affected voting behavior nationwide. In New York State, home to over 19.3 million residents, the pandemic had a dramatic impact. Over 1.5 million COVID-19 cases and more than 35,000 deaths were reported by the end of 2020, creating a public health crisis that discouraged in-person voting and shifted the focus toward absentee ballots. In the 2020 general election, New York saw a record 45% increase in absentee ballot usage compared to previous years, with more than 2 million absentee ballots cast out of a total 8.6 million votes.

Our team seeks to analyze how these extraordinary circumstances shaped voter turnout, voting methods, and participation trends across New York State. By integrating demographic data, COVID-19 statistics, and election results, we aim to uncover how New Yorkers adapted to these challenges and what it reveals about the resilience of democracy in the face of crisis.

### Motivation 

### Meet Our Team
Thank you so much for visiting our site! We are a team of graduate students at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, united by a shared passion for understanding the intersections of public health, data science, and democracy. Coming from diverse academic backgrounds and programs, we’ve joined forces to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on voting behavior during the historic 2020 election in New York State.

Through this project, we aim to sharpen our skills in applied biostatistics, data visualization, and public health communication while contributing meaningful insights into how crises shape electoral processes. We hope our work not only informs but also inspires conversations about the resilience of democratic systems in the face of unprecedented challenges.
